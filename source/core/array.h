/**
 * Description
 * ===========
 *
 * Manages accesses and assignments on an already allocated buffer of
 * :c:type:`uint8_t` elements, keeping track of its usage. A common use case is
 * buffer management of UTF-8 strings, or operations on binary data, characters
 * and strings over a fixed :c:type:`uint8_t` buffer in general. Each
 * :c:struct:`ARRAY` instance should handle a unique buffer. The Array instance
 * does not own the buffer passed at initialization and will never try to free
 * or reallocate it.
 *
 *
 * Design and development status
 * =============================
 *
 * This is not a full-featured Array implementation. Only the bare
 * minimum functionality required for known use cases has been implemented.
 * String and binary stores are not optimized for speed; these are executed one
 * element at a time by internal calls to :c:func:`ARRAY_AppendOne`.
 *
