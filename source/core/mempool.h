/**
 * Description
 * ===========
 *
 * Manages an already allocated memory region at a specified address by
 * assigning blocks of a requested size. Once assigned, blocks are static
 * and cannot be released or freed. This approach has the following
 * advantages:
 *
 * - The managed memory region is divided according to a fixed sequence
 *   of block requests. The resulting memory map is deterministic, and the
 *   user documentation can precisely describe its arrangement.
 * - No dynamic memory allocation implies no memory fragmentation and
 *   no need to handle the complexity of sudden out of memory conditions.
 * - There might be several memory pools residing on different
 *   memory types (a given SRAM bank, external SDRAM, etc.), each one
 *   serving a different purpose.
 *
 * The managed memory region address, each block assigned from it and their
 * sizes align to a 64-bit boundary.
 *
 *
 * Design and development status

 * Feature-complete.
