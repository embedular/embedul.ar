/**
 * Description
 * ===========
 *
 * Manages accesses and writes to a bitfield stored in an already allocated
 * buffer of :c:type:`uint32_t` elements. A :c:struct:`BITFIELD` instance should
 * manage its unique buffer. Each :c:type:`uint32_t` in the buffer will give 32
 * unique bits. Bits are indexed from the least significant bit starting at
 * zero. For example, the first :c:type:`uint32_t` in the buffer will hold bits
 * 0 to 31, the second :c:type:`uint32_t` will hold bits 32 to 63 and so on.
 *
 * There are two modes of operation with their own set of functions:
 *
 * Single bit
 *   Individual bits are set and get by their ``BitIndex``.
 *
 * Bit range (multibit values)
 *   An array of :c:struct:`BITFIELD_RANGE` is passed to
 *   :c:func:`BITFIELD_Init`. The :c:type:`uint32_t` buffer will hold
 *   bit ranges; bits grouped as specified by elements on a
 *   :c:struct:`BITFIELD_RANGE` array. Each range element is indexed on that
 *   array by a ``RangeIndex``.
 *
 * .. note:: It is OK to define a :c:struct:`BITFIELD_RANGE` array with ranges
 *           starting at some arbitrary bitIndex, then managing the bits below
 *           as single bits. An actual framework use case stores a gamepad's
 *           state with several digital switches as single bits and additional
 *           analog inputs like sticks and accelerometers as bit ranges
 *           according to the required resolution.
